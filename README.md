# Sales Data Analysis

This is a Sales Data Analysis project which was made using Python, SQL, and Pandas. The user enters the employee and product information into excel spreadsheets, and then tables are created
using this information. The program adds this all to the database and uses data analysis to figure out the top sales by product, top sales by month, and top employees by sales. The findings
are then added to a PDF which the program generates onto the user's computer.
